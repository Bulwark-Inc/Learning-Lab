# 🟡 Level 2 – API Builder & AI Integrator

Welcome to **Level 2** of my dev learning journey!  
This stage is all about combining **Python APIs**, **AI integration**, and **React frontends** — to build real, connected tools.

## 🎯 Level 2 Goals

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Django REST | Build APIs, use serializers, views, routers |
| OpenAI API | Use GPT for chatbot and summarization |
| React + Axios | Fetch data from custom APIs |
| Auth | Token or JWT protection for endpoints |
| Deployment | Push one fullstack project live |
| Public Sharing | Reddit posts for feedback + learning |
