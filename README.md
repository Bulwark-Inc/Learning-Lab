# Portfolio Projects

Welcome! This is a collection of my small, practical projects built to sharpen my full-stack and AI development skills.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack I often use:
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
- **AI/Automation**: OpenAI API, scraping scripts, automation tools
- **Other**: HTML/CSS, Python GUIs (Tkinter, Pygame), scripting

Each folder contains a small project with its own README and source code. These projects are often referenced in posts or shared for feedback.

Feel free to explore or clone anything!
